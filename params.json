{"name":"welcome to anthony atto's homepage","tagline":"trained statistician, armchair economist.","body":"### a note to prospective employers\r\nhey.  i'm anthony.  \r\n\r\ni realized a resume doesn't cut it anymore.  i've created a few repositories of projects i've worked on for you to get a sense of my statistical and coding ability.  some are class projects, others are personal projects i've done to learn a new skill or package.  \r\n\r\n### on syntactic style\r\nmuch more time is spent reading code than writing code. my preference and style thus focuses on *readability*.  you'll notice that i'm am a willing slave to the 'hadleyverse.'  the chain operator (%>%) reverses illogical nesting and allows code to be read like a sentence.   hadley's naming conventions are intuitive and descriptive, enough so for those unfamiliar with packages (or even code) to be able to interpret what is going on.\r\n\r\na tradeoff for readability is often speed.  this is a tradeoff i'm willing to make.  if my analysis, visualization, or prediction is first proven and understood by my audience, speed enhancements for a production product can be made after the fact.\r\n\r\n### on work history\r\ni've worked in the oil and gas industry for 6+ years.  at no point in time have i ever had to write a line of code for my job.\r\n\r\nwhile my *experience* is not reflective of a data scientist, i hope that it is not completely discounted.  working in a variety of positions and locations demonstrates flexibility and breadth.  earning a supervisory role at a young age (young for a staid company and industry) signifies strong leadership, performance, and trust.  developing a business case to justify financing a civil engineer to get a masters in statistics (why don't you do an mba like everyone else?) part time while working full time exemplifies my hustle.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
