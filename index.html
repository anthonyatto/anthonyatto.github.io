<p>hey.  i'm anthony.  </p>

<p>i realized a resume doesn't cut it anymore.  i've created a few repositories of projects i've worked on for you to get a sense of my statistical and coding ability.  some are class projects, others are personal projects i've done to learn a new skill or package.  </p>

<p>much more time is spent reading code than writing code. my preference and style thus focuses on <em>readability</em>.  you'll notice that i'm am a willing slave to the 'hadleyverse.'  the chain operator (%&gt;%) reverses illogical nesting and allows code to be read like a sentence.   hadley's naming conventions are intuitive and descriptive, enough so for those unfamiliar with packages (or even code) to be able to interpret what is going on.</p>

<p>a tradeoff for readability is often speed.  this is a tradeoff i'm willing to make.  if my analysis, visualization, or prediction is first proven and understood by my audience, speed enhancements for a production product can be made after the fact.</p>

<a id="on-work-history" class="anchor" href="#on-work-history" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>on work history</h3>

<p>i've worked in the oil and gas industry for 6+ years.  at no point in time have i ever had to write a line of code for my job.</p>

<p>while my <em>experience</em> is not reflective of a data scientist, i hope that it is not completely discounted.  working in a variety of positions and locations demonstrates flexibility and breadth.  earning a supervisory role at a young age (young for a staid company and industry) signifies strong leadership, performance, and trust.  developing a business case to justify financing a civil engineer to get a masters in statistics (why don't you do an mba like everyone else?) part time while working full time exemplifies my hustle.</p>
